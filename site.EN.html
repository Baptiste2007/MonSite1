                        <p class="lead mb50">First of all, I wanted to talk about my main passion, which is running
                            (running). This sport where I was interested a little more than a year ago thanks to
                            a final sports project organized by my high school. Before I hated running, I arrived
                            not even to run 2km and now I run half marathons in 1h44. But I don’t do them
                            to have a good time, but more to feel better in my body and in my mind.
                            But I still have a goal to do a marathon in 2026.</p>

                        <p class="lead mb50">My second passion is cycling, a less hard and more accessible sport is
                            great to do with the family or to go for very long distances, like going to the sea in
                            bike what I have been doing for 2 years with my big brother (107 km). I will also do a
                            190km in 2026, it might seem like a lot but it’s a sport that challenges and makes
                            long distance by bike it allows to see landscapes that we do not necessarily see
                            in the car. </p>

                                                <p>a period when I changed a lot and the moment when I had

                                                    to work. But I really started to be motivated in
                                                    First thanks to this meeting but also thanks to the professor
                                                    genious that I had who motivated me and who reminded me and also the

                                                    means the baccalaureate made up of a lot of trials that I have

                                                    thanks to this motivations which increased in the queue of time
                                                    thanks to the
                                                    good note that I harvested thanks to my numerous hours of revision
                                                    because some person had to review 30min for an evaluation me
                                                    it was 3 hours maybe a lot but at least I have good grades and
                                                    in the end I got my baccalaureate with honors quite well which
